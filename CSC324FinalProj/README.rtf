KiwiCoffeeShopDBMS

Note: To open the webpage, go and click on index. The sql.txt contains the tables for the project.
In addition, I provided the kcoffeeshop.sql that I worked on querying all of my data on PostgreSQL.
However, I had difficulty applying it to my final model since I had trouble with the shopping cart
where a variable was being read as a string with PostgreSQL and therefore led me to resort to using MySQL instead.
Thank you for understanding.
